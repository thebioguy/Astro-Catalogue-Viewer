# Roadmap

This roadmap is directional and will adjust based on user feedback.

## Now (next 1-2 releases)
- Duplicate detection and filename conflict resolution
- Archive image action (to remove duplicate images with different file names) with configurable archive folder
- Messier metadata refresh with richer descriptions and fixed links, and DOS specific technical specs
- Faster first-run setup and clearer folder validation
- Better "Suggested" logic (visibility rules + seasonality explanation)

## Near term
- Batch actions (tag, status, notes)
- Advanced filters (equipment, focal length, capture year)
- Optional thumbnails cache to speed large libraries

## Later
- Cross-device sync (opt-in)
- Curated catalog packs and guided capture lists
- Automation hooks (AstroBin / PixInsight / Siril export helpers)

## Ideas under evaluation
- Mobile companion viewer
- Community shareable collections
- Pro tools for commercial or educational users
