# Sponsor Pitch

Astro Catalogue Viewer helps astrophotographers stay organized, plan targets, and track progress across Messier, NGC, IC, Caldwell, and more. I build and maintain it as a solo developer.

Your support helps cover:
- catalog data cleanup and verification
- UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements
- faster releases and better cross-platform support

## Suggested tiers
- $3/mo — Star Gazer: Name in the README supporters section.
- $5/mo — Clear Skies: Above + early access to beta releases.
- $10/mo — Deep Sky: Above + vote on the next small feature or dataset tweak each month.
- $25/mo — Observatory: Above + your name/logo in the app’s About screen.

If the app saves you time or helps you plan better sessions, consider supporting:
